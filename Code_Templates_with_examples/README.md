# Code Templates with Examples

This folder contains general Arduino code templates for both beginners and advanced learners. 
The templates are designed to provide a starting point for creating new projects and understanding common Arduino programming concepts.

## Basics
1. **Blink_Template.ino**
   - Blinks an LED repeatedly.
   - Teaches digital output and timing with `delay()`.

2. **Button_Input_Template.ino**
   - Reads a button press and toggles an LED.
   - Teaches digital input, state toggling, and simple debounce.

## Advanced
1. **PWM_Breathing_Template.ino**
   - Smoothly increases and decreases LED brightness using PWM.
   - Teaches `analogWrite()` and creating smooth animations.

2. **LED_Sequence_Template.ino**
   - Turns multiple LEDs on in a sequence and then back.
   - Teaches arrays, loops, and sequencing multiple outputs.

## How to Use
- Open any template `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
- Connect the necessary components according to the code comments.
- Upload the sketch to your Arduino board and observe the behavior.
- Modify variables and loops to experiment and learn.
