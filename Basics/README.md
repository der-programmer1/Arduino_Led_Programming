# Arduino LED Basics

This section introduces the fundamental concepts of Arduino LED programming.  
Youâ€™ll learn how to control LEDs, understand digital outputs, and build confidence with simple circuits.

## Included Examples
- **Blink:** The classic first Arduino program â€” turn an LED on and off at regular intervals.
- **Multiple LEDs:** Control several LEDs independently using loops and pin arrays.
- **Fade:** Create smooth LED brightness transitions using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).

## What You Learn
- How to use `pinMode()` and `digitalWrite()` to control pins
- How to work with time delays using `delay()`
- Introduction to `analogWrite()` for dimming LEDs
- Basic use of loops (`for`) for repetitive tasks

## Circuit Requirements
- 1â€“3 LEDs (any color)
- 220Î© resistors(Does not matter..)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano, or Mega)

## Learning Goal
By completing the Basics section, you will:
- Understand how Arduino handles digital output
- Gain confidence with simple electronic components
- Be ready to move on to **interactive and advanced LED projects**
