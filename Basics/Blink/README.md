# Blink Example

The most basic Arduino example — making an LED blink on and off.

## What You Learn
- How to set up an output pin
- The use of `digitalWrite()` and `delay()`
- The structure of `setup()` and `loop()` functions

## Circuit
- LED connected to pin 13 (through a 220Ω resistor)
- Ground connected to the LED’s cathode

This example introduces the fundamental concept of digital output control in Arduino.
