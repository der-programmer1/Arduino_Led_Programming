# Fade Example

This example introduces analog control through PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) to vary LED brightness smoothly.

## What You Learn
- How to use `analogWrite()` for PWM control
- How to create smooth transitions with variables
- The concept of analog output in Arduino

## Circuit
- LED connected to pin 9 (PWM-capable)
- 220Ω resistor between pin and LED

This project helps you understand how to simulate analog control digitally — essential for dimming lights or 
controlling motors.
