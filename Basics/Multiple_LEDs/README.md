# Multiple LEDs Example

This example demonstrates how to control several LEDs in sequence using loops.

## What You Learn
- How to use arrays to manage multiple output pins
- How to iterate with `for` loops
The use od `delay` for `onTime` and `offTime`
- Sequential LED control

## Circuit
- Three LEDs connected to pins 8, 9, and 10
- Each LED connected through a 220Î© resistor to ground. Actually does not matter.

This example builds on the basics by introducing arrays and loop structures.
