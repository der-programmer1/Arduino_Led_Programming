# 🎛️ Arduino Projects Hub

Welcome to my **Arduino Projects Hub**, a growing collection of interactive hardware experiments.  
This repository includes **LEDs, buzzers, sensors, and more**, with projects designed for **learning, prototyping, and creative experimentation**.

![Demo](docs/demo.gif) <!-- Replace with your GIF or screenshot -->

---

## 🌟 Current Features

- Randomized LED patterns and blinking experiments  
- Buzzer tone generation with configurable randomness  
- Basic input/output projects for Arduino beginners  
- Configurable timing, patterns, and hardware assignments  
- No external libraries required (most projects)

---

## 🔮 Future Plans

- Expand with **more sensors** (temperature, light, motion)  
- Add **interactive projects** (buttons, switches, user input)  
- Create **multi-device synchronization** examples  
- Include **advanced LED and buzzer patterns**  
- Document and demo projects with GIFs, schematics, and tutorials  

---

## 🛠️ Hardware Overview

- Arduino Uno, Nano, or compatible boards  
- LEDs, buzzers, resistors, and other basic components  
- Jumper wires, breadboards, and optional sensors  
- Flexible setup: the repository is not limited to a specific number of components

## 📦 How to Use

1. Browse the project folders in the repository  
2. Open the `.ino` files in **Arduino IDE**  
3. Connect the required hardware according to the folder/project description  
4. Upload and run sketches  
5. Experiment with timings, pins, and patterns to customize the behavior  

> Each project contains notes on **hardware setup, pin assignments, and configuration** to make it easy to start experimenting.
