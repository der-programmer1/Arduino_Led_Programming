# Random LED Effects Example

This example uses the `random()` function to create unpredictable LED lighting.

## What You Learn
- Generating random numbers with `random()` and `randomSeed()`
- Creating dynamic, non-repetitive LED effects
- Combining randomness with control logic

## Circuit
- Three LEDs connected to pins 8–10 (each with a 220Ω resistor(really does'nt matter(for short life LED)))
- Common ground connection

Adding randomness makes LED projects look more organic and fun.
