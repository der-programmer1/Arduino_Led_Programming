# LED Patterns Example

This example shows how to create LED patterns using loops and arrays.

## What You Learn
- Using arrays to control multiple pins
- Creating sequential and reverse lighting patterns
- Managing timing with the `delay()` function

## Circuit
- Four LEDs connected to pins 8–11 (each with a 220Ω resistor(does'nt matter))
- Common ground connection

These patterns help you practice structured programming and timing logic.
