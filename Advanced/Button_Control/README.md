# Button Control Example

This example demonstrates how to use a push button to control an LED.

## What You Learn
- Reading digital input from a button
- Using `INPUT_PULLUP` for reliable button detection
- Applying conditional logic with `if` statements

## Circuit
- LED connected to pin 9 (with a 220Î© resistor(actually does not matter))
- Button connected to pin 2 and ground

When the button is pressed, the LED turns on. This is your first step into interactive Arduino projects.
