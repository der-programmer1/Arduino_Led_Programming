# Advanced Arduino LED Projects

This folder contains advanced Arduino LED projects designed for learners who have completed the basics and want to explore more complex concepts, including PWM, sequencing, and animation.

## Included Projects

### 1. Button Control
- **Folder:** Button_Control/
- **Purpose:** Learn how to control LEDs interactively using a push button.
- **What You Learn:** Digital input reading, conditional logic, using `INPUT_PULLUP`, simple interactivity.
- **Hardware:** LEDs, push button, 220Ω resistors.

### 2. Patterns
- **Folder:** Patterns/
- **Purpose:** Create structured LED sequences to understand loops and arrays.
- **What You Learn:** Controlling multiple LEDs with arrays, sequencing, timing with `delay()`.
- **Hardware:** 4 LEDs, 220Ω resistors.

### 3. Random Effects
- **Folder:** Random_Effects/
- **Purpose:** Add unpredictability and creative effects to LEDs.
- **What You Learn:** Using `random()` and `randomSeed()`, dynamic lighting effects.
- **Hardware:** 3 LEDs, 220Ω resistors.

### 4. PWM Fading
- **Folder:** PWM_Fading/
- **Purpose:** Smoothly fade an LED in and out using PWM.
- **What You Learn:** Using `analogWrite()` for brightness control, loops with variable increments, handling boundaries.
- **Hardware:** 1 LED on PWM pin, 220Ω resistor.

### 5. Knight Rider
- **Folder:** Knight_Rider/
- **Purpose:** Simulate the famous "Knight Rider" running light effect.
- **What You Learn:** Sequencing multiple LEDs, forward and backward animation, timing.
- **Hardware:** 5 LEDs, 220Ω resistors.

## Learning Goals
After completing these projects, learners will:
- Understand advanced LED control techniques.
- Gain experience with PWM for smooth fading.
- Learn how to create sequences and animations.
- Explore interactive control using buttons.
- Develop confidence in structuring multiple Arduino projects.

## How to Use
Each project folder contains:
- **`.ino` file:** Complete Arduino sketch ready to upload.
- **README.md:** Detailed explanation of the project, what you learn, and hardware setup.

Open a project folder, upload the `.ino` file to your Arduino board, and experiment with the code. Adjust timing, sequences, and hardware as needed to enhance learning and creativity.
