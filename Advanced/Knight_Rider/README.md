# Knight Rider LED Example

This project creates a "Knight Rider" running light effect with multiple LEDs.

## What You Learn
- Sequencing multiple LEDs
- Forward and backward animation
- Timing and delays

## Hardware
- 5 LEDs connected to pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10
- 220Î© resistors(you know, it does not matter..)

## How It Works
The LEDs turn on one after another in a forward sequence, then in a reverse sequence, simulating the famous 
Knight Rider effect.
