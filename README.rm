# Arduino LED Programming Repository

This repository is a comprehensive learning resource for Arduino LED programming. 
It includes both basic and advanced projects, as well as code templates with examples for fast experimentation.

## Repository Structure

- **Basics/**  
  Simple LED projects to learn the fundamentals, including blinking, multiple LEDs, and fading.

- **Advanced/**  
  More complex projects covering interactive control, sequences, PWM fading, and animation effects like Knight Rider.

- **code_templates_with_examples/**  
  Ready-to-use code templates for beginners and advanced users. Includes both basic examples (blink, button input) and advanced examples (PWM breathing, LED sequences).




- **Coming soon**  
  Circuit diagrams, screenshots, or GIFs to support learning.

## Getting Started

1. Install the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect your Arduino board.
3. Open the desired `.ino` file in the IDE.
4. Upload the sketch and follow any instructions in the project README.

## Learning Goals

- Understand LED control using digital and PWM signals.
- Learn sequencing, animation, and interactive projects.
- Apply structured coding practices with arrays, loops, and functions.
- Build confidence progressing from beginner to advanced projects.
